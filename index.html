        <p id="first">My name is Hayk Ferayan. I am currently enrolled in the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp. Prior to this course, I was pursuing a degree in Economics at Pierce College. After taking general education courses along with the courses required for my major, I began to think this was not the right path for me. Shortly after, I began to explore different fields and started to think deeply about what type of career I should pursue. Subsequently, I began researching coding and programming and of its possibilities.</p>

        <p id="second">It was at this time that I began to take an interest in coding. I took some free lessons online and after a while decided that it is a profession I could work in. I visited and researched a few coding schools and concluded that UCLA Extension is the best fit for me.</p>
        <p id="third">After the completion of this program, I would like to utilize my new skills and immediately work full time in web development while doing freelance work on the side.</p>
